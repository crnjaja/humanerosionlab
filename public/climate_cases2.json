They were initially sentenced to three months’ imprisonment, wholly suspended for two years. On appeal, the Queensland District Court found the sentences manifestly excessive and ruled that the lower court had failed to properly consider their rights to protest. The court reduced the penalty to a fine of AUD 1,000 each and ordered that no convictions be recorded. The case highlighted judicial recognition of the right to peaceful protest and was supported by environmental advocacy groups, reflecting strong civil society involvement in defending climate activism.",

The applicant argued that environmental degradation in Kiribati, including disappearing islands and contaminated freshwater sources, constituted persecution under the 1951 Refugee Convention. The Tribunal acknowledged the severity of the environmental challenges but concluded that the harms were not inflicted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group, or political opinion. Consequently, it determined that the applicant did not meet the criteria for refugee status under Australian law and affirmed the decision to deny the visa. This case underscored the limitations of existing refugee frameworks in addressing climate-induced displacement.",

The claim centered on the agencies' inadequate reporting of the environmental impacts of their financing activities, particularly those related to fossil fuel projects, and their failure to demonstrate how their operations aligned with principles of ecologically sustainable development, including the precautionary principle and intergenerational equity. Following the initiation of legal proceedings, both EFA and NAIF updated their reporting practices to include more comprehensive disclosures of environmental and climate-related impacts. As a result, Jubilee Australia discontinued the proceedings in early 2025, recognizing the agencies' improved compliance. ",

The respondent challenges the timing of the alleged duty and breach, stating that certain obligations could only logically arise after August 2021 when specific targets were defined based on the \"Global 1.5°C Budget\" from the AR6 WGI report. The respondent asserts that the determination of national GHG emissions targets is a high-level government policy decision involving various factors, and the court should not impose a duty of care in this regard. The respondent questions the definition of \"Best Available Science\" provided by the applicants, highlighting that the body of information evolves over time and lacks consistency in opinions of individual authors. Without specific details on the reports and literature constituting the Best Available Science, the respondent cannot admit the allegations. The respondent acknowledges the existence of reports from scientific bodies like the IPCC, WMO, UNEP, CSIRO, BOM, and CCA on climate change impacts and mitigation strategies since around 2014 but emphasizes the evolving nature of scientific knowledge in this field. The respondent discusses adaptation options available to some Torres Strait Islanders to protect themselves from projected climate change impacts, such as building retrofitting, seawall construction, and ecosystem restoration. However, the respondent states it cannot admit certain allegations due to lack of knowledge. The respondent acknowledges the native title determination QUD6199\/1998 (Gibuma on behalf of the Boigu People v State of Queensland [2004] FCA 1575) (the Boigu People Determination), where the Boigu People, including members of the Pabai family, were recognized as native title holders in a specific area described in the determination. The respondent states that the Boigu People were recognized as native title holders in respect of the determination area, which includes most of the land and waters on the landward side of the high water mark of Boigu Island, except for specific parcels of land identified in the determination . The respondent does not admit certain allegations related to native title rights due to a lack of knowledge or information.",

In June 2021, the Brussels Court of First Instance found the defendants had breached their duty of care but declined to impose specific emissions targets, citing separation of powers. On appeal, the Brussels Court of Appeal ruled that the federal government, Flemish Region, and Brussels-Capital Region had violated both their duty of care and human rights obligations, ordering them to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55% by 2030 compared to 1990 levels. The Walloon Region was not found in breach, having met prior targets. This landmark decision, supported by extensive civil society mobilization, marked the first time a Belgian court imposed binding climate targets on the government, reinforcing the enforceability of human rights in climate litigation.",

The case is landmark in requiring judicial accountability for climate inaction and treating climate commitments as enforceable obligations. ",

The case highlights the human right to a healthy environment, as protected under Article 21 of the Indian Constitution, and emphasizes the state’s duty to conserve biodiversity for current and future generations. Civil society played a key role, with environmental experts and conservation groups using public interest litigation to advocate for species protection, leading the court to order measures such as bird diverters and encouraging further studies on underground cabling.",

The companies had challenged the 2007 and 2010 regulations, arguing they violated the Electricity Act, 2003, which promotes de-licensed, self-regulated captive power generation. The Court rejected this argument, affirming that the renewable energy obligation aligns with constitutional principles, including the right to a clean environment (Article 21) and environmental protection duties (Articles 48A and 51A(g)). The Court emphasized the public interest in promoting green energy and noted consistency with India’s international climate commitments.",

However, in the cases at hand, complainants’ fundamental rights were not violated preemptively, because the state legislatures are not subject to a CO2 emissions budget, which (according to the Court in Neubauer v. Germany) is a prerequisite for such an effect. Rather, it is the federal German legislature that is bound by the CO2 budget, but has a prerogative with respect to its implementation. As regards the federal states, the Court clarified that they too are responsible for climate protection, in particular by virtue of Article 20a of the Basic Law.",

The Civil Court of Rome dismissed the case, citing lack of jurisdiction and emphasizing the separation of powers. The plaintiffs have appealed the decision, arguing that the judiciary has a role in ensuring the protection of fundamental rights threatened by climate inaction. The appeal is still pending, with the first hearing scheduled for January 2025, it is expected that the recent KlimaSeniorinnen judgement might have an influence on the outcome. ",

Milieudefensie demands that ING align its policies with the Paris Agreement by reducing its total greenhouse gas emissions by 50 % by 2030 and stopping financial support to companies without adequate climate transition plans.",

CEMDA argued that eliminating the fund violated the constitutional right to a healthy environment by weakening transparency, potentially even to support fossil fuels. The initial injunction was denied, and on April 12, 2023, the Mexican Supreme Court upheld the reform. The Court ruled that decisions on public policy mechanisms, such as reallocating climate funds through the federal budget, fall under the legislative and executive branches, not the judiciary. ",

The Oslo District Court ruled the approvals unlawful and issued a temporary injunction, but the Appeals Court later overturned it citing economic and political considerations. In April 2025, Norway’s Supreme Court reversed the Appeals Court, ruling that courts must grant temporary measures if EU law violations causing potential environmental harm are probable, and sent the case back for reconsideration.

The Hague court ordered the government to cut greenhouse gas emissions by at least 25% below 1990 levels by 2020, finding its existing target of 17% insufficient to meet the UN goal of limiting warming to 2°C.

New Zealand's courts denied his application, stating that the conditions did not meet the criteria for refugee status under international law. Teitiota then brought his case to the UN Human Rights Committee, alleging that his deportation violated his right to life under Article 6 of the ICCPR. On 7 January 2020, the Committee concluded that, while the effects of climate change could pose a threat to the right to life and might, in extreme cases, prohibit deportation, Teitiota's specific circumstances did not meet this condition. This case marks the first time an international human rights body recognized that climate change could impact the right to life. ",

The Supreme Court of Nepal found that the government's failure to implement effective flood mitigation measures violated constitutional rights, including the right to live with dignity, access to basic health services, and the right to food and shelter. The Court emphasized the state's obligations under international frameworks like the UNFCCC, the Paris Agreement, the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction and the Yokohama Guidelines for Natural Disaster Prevention. It issued a mandamus directing the government to provide relief and develop strategies for disaster risk reduction and adaptation to climate change.  ",

They argued that this target was insufficient to prevent catastrophic climate change and violated their fundamental rights, including the right to life, health, and a healthy environment. The Constitutional Court consolidated this case with two other constitutional cases challenging the same NDC and one case challenging the implementation plan of the NDC, the 1st Carbon Neutrality Basic Plan. On August 29, 2024, the Court ruled that Article 8(1) of the Framework Act on Carbon Neutrality and Green Growth was unconstitutional for failing to set emission reduction targets between 2031 and 2049, thereby violating the right to a healthy environment under Article 35 of the Constitution. The Court ordered the National Assembly to amend the law by February 28, 2026. In February 2025, the South Korean government promised a long-term plan to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050, whereas previous plans were limited to 2030.",

The plaintiffs argued that the government's target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by at least 35% by 2030, compared to 2018 levels, was arbitrary and insufficient to meet the standards agreed upon by the scientific community and the international community. They contended that this target violated their constitutional rights, including the right to life, equality, property, and a healthy environment. The case was consolidated with three other climate litigation cases and heard by the Constitutional Court of South Korea.",

On August 29, 2024, the Court ruled that Article 8(1) of the Framework Act on Carbon Neutrality and Green Growth for Coping with Climate Crisis was unconstitutional for failing to set post-2030 emission reduction targets, thus infringing upon the rights of future generations.

United States was a landmark constitutional climate lawsuit brought by 21 youth plaintiffs who argued that the U.S. government’s longstanding support for a fossil fuel-based energy system knowingly contributed to climate instability, violating their constitutional rights to life, liberty, property, and equal protection. Invoking the public trust doctrine, the plaintiffs claimed the government had a duty to preserve natural resources like the atmosphere for future generations. Although the case initially survived dismissal attempts and gained global attention, it was ultimately thrown out on procedural grounds: in 2020, the Ninth Circuit ruled the plaintiffs lacked standing, and in 2025 the Supreme Court declined to hear the case, ending it without trial. The lawsuit prompted unprecedented civil society support, with numerous amicus curiae briefs filed by scientists, legal scholars, environmental NGOs, faith leaders, and public health experts, who emphasized the legitimacy of the plaintiffs’ claims and the urgent need for judicial recognition of climate rights.",

The claimants contended that the government's failure to revise the 2050 target constituted a breach of its duties under the Climate Change Act and violated their rights under the European Convention on Human Rights, specifically the rights to life, private and family life, and protection from discrimination. In July 2018, the High Court dismissed the case, ruling that the government's decision not to amend the 2050 target was lawful and within its discretion. The court held that the Paris Agreement did not impose binding domestic legal obligations and that the existing target was consistent with the UK's international commitments at the time.

The lawsuit seeks to compel the USPS to perform a comprehensive environmental impact assessment and to prioritize the acquisition of electric vehicles to mitigate environmental harm. ",

Appellate Body: Japan argues environmental protection cannot be considered in a benefit analysis. There is no legal basis in the SCM Agreement to justify an otherwise prohibited subsidy on grounds such as environmental protection. Indeed, domestic content requirements are irrelevant for purposes such as protection of the environment or promotion of human health.

The EIB rejected the request by maintaining that the resolution of its Board of Directors is not an \"administrative act\" with binding external effects and that it was not adopted \"under environmental law\".  As such, the decision in question would not fall within the scope of the request for internal review as set out in Article 10 of the Aarhus Regulation. The EU General Court annulled the EIB decision rejecting as inadmissible the request for an internal review by ClientEarth. It found that the EIB resolution approving the biomass power plant was adopted \"under environmental law\", which is to be interpreted as having a broad meaning. Additionally, according to the Court, the resolution produced certain final binding effects vis-à-vis a third party (i.e., the promoter of the project). Appeals by the EIB and the European Commission were dismissed by the Court of Justice, which confirmed the findings of the General Court.",

While the Conseil d’État partially upheld the application, including in view of the municipality's particular vulnerability to climate change-induced flooding, it denied that Mr. Carême had legal standing as a private citizen. Mr. Carême thereafter applied to the European Court of Human Rights and alleged that, by taking insufficient climate mitigation and adaptation measures, France had violated his rights to life and to respect for private and family life. The European Court of Human Rights rejected the case as inadmissible by finding that the applicant cannot be considered a victim, as he does not reside in Grande-Synthe anymore.",

The authorities' refusal was challenged by the applicants before national courts, which, however, always considered the applicants' complaints to constitute an inadmissible actio popularis. The applicants therefore turned to the European Court of Human Rights and alleged that the insufficient climate action of the Swiss Government infringes on their rights to life and to respect for private and family life. Additionally, they maintained that the inadmissibility of their complaints at the national level infringes on their rights to access to court and to an effective remedy. The European Court of Human Rights found that the applicant association had legal standing and that Switzerland had violated Articles 8 (right to respect for private and family life) and 6 (right to access to court) of the Euopean Convention on Human Rights.",

The request for review was premised, inter alia, on the Paris Agreement, the Charter of Fundamental Rights and Article 191 TFEU (high level of environmental protection). According to the claimant, AggregateEU infringes on fundamental rights by not imposing any limits on methane emissions associated with the gas sold through it.
